## Configuration

### Word Lists (Easy Customization)

Edit `examples/voice_agents/interruption_config.py`:

```python
# Soft acknowledgments (ignored while agent is speaking)
SOFT_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS = [
    "yeah",
    "ok",
    "hmm",
    "right",
    "uh-huh",
    "mhmm",
    "yup",      # Add your words here
]

# Hard interruptions (always stop agent)
HARD_INTERRUPTIONS = [
    "wait",
    "stop",
    "pause",
    "hold on",  # Add your words here
]

# Timing thresholds (in seconds)
MIN_SPEECH_DURATION = 1.0       # Very hard to interrupt before this
SHORT_SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 3.0    # Conservative interruption
LONG_SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 8.0     # More lenient interruption
```

**No code changes needed** - just edit this file and restart the agent!

## Running the Agent

### Audio Mode (Voice Input)

Test with real voice input:

```bash
cd examples\voice_agents
python smart_interruption_agent.py console 
```

Speak using your microphone to test interruption handling.

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Soft Acknowledgment (No Interruption)

**Goal**: Verify agent continues speaking without pause

1. Start the agent: `python smart_interruption_agent.py console `
2. Ask: **"Tell me about artificial intelligence"**
3. While agent is speaking, say: **"yeah"**
4. **Expected**: Agent continues speaking seamlessly ✅
5. **Fail if**: Agent pauses, stutters, or stops ❌

### Test Case 2: Hard Interruption

**Goal**: Verify agent stops immediately

1. Start the agent
2. Ask: **"Explain quantum computing"**
3. While agent is speaking, say: **"wait"**
4. **Expected**: Agent stops immediately ✅
5. **Fail if**: Agent continues speaking ❌

### Test Case 3: Mixed Phrase Detection

**Goal**: Verify semantic parsing handles mixed input

1. Start the agent
2. Ask: **"What is machine learning?"**
3. While agent is speaking, say: **"Yeah wait a second"**
4. **Expected**: Agent stops (detects "wait") ✅
5. **Fail if**: Agent continues (only sees "yeah") ❌

### Test Case 4: Context Awareness (Agent Idle)

**Goal**: Verify agent processes input when NOT speaking

1. Agent finishes speaking and waits
2. User says: **"yeah"**
3. **Expected**: Agent processes "yeah" as valid input ✅
4. **Fail if**: Agent ignores the input ❌

### Test Case 5: Timing Sensitivity

**Goal**: Verify timing-based interrupt difficulty

1. Ask a question that generates a long response
2. Try interrupting at different times:
   - **0.5 seconds**: Say "wait" (hard to interrupt)
   - **2 seconds**: Say "wait" (moderate)
   - **5 seconds**: Say "wait" (easy to interrupt)
   - **10 seconds**: Say "wait" (very easy)

3. **Expected**: Earlier interrupts require more urgency ✅

## How It Works

### 1. State-Based Filtering

The agent tracks its own state (speaking vs idle):

```
Agent SPEAKING + "yeah" → Continue (ignore)
Agent IDLE + "yeah" → Process as input
Agent SPEAKING + "wait" → Stop (interrupt)
```

**Key Implementation**: The logic layer sits between STT and the agent's audio stream, intercepting transcripts and making decisions before audio stops.

### 2. Semantic Analysis

Pattern matching classifies user input:

**Soft Acknowledgments** (ignored while speaking):
- "yeah", "ok", "hmm", "right", "uh-huh"
- Agent continues seamlessly

**Hard Interruptions** (always stop):
- "wait", "hold on", "stop", "but", "actually"
- Agent stops immediately

**Mixed Phrases** (intelligent parsing):
- Input: "Yeah wait a second"
- Detection: Contains "wait" (hard word)
- Action: **Stop** (command takes precedence)

### 3. Timing Awareness

Interruption difficulty adjusts by speech duration:

- **0-1 seconds**: Very hard to interrupt (just started)
- **1-3 seconds**: Conservative (soft acks ignored)
- **3-8 seconds**: Normal sensitivity
- **8+ seconds**: More lenient (long speech)

### 4. Urgency Detection

Audio features analyzed in real-time:

- **Volume**: Louder = higher urgency
- **Pitch**: Sharper tone = higher urgency  
- **Duration**: Quick interjection = higher urgency

### Why It Doesn't Stutter

The key is `_should_interrupt()` is called **before** stopping audio:

```python
def _should_interrupt(self, transcript: str) -> bool:
    # Returns False for soft acks → audio keeps playing
    # Returns True for hard interrupts → audio stops
    # No intermediate "pause" state exists
```

The framework asks "Should I interrupt?" and our logic returns:
- `False` → Keep playing audio (no stutter)
- `True` → Stop audio (interrupt)

This is why there's no "pause and resume" - the audio stream never stops for soft acknowledgments.

### Decision Flow

```
User speaks during agent speech
    ↓
STT transcribes → "yeah wait"
    ↓
_should_interrupt(transcript) called
    ↓
Get agent state (SPEAKING) + duration (5.2s)
    ↓
Extract audio features (volume, pitch)
    ↓
Classifier checks patterns:
    1. Contains "wait"? → YES → HARD INTERRUPT
    2. Hard interrupt detected → STOP
    ↓
Apply timing adjustment (5.2s → moderate)
Apply urgency boost (if loud/sharp)
Calculate confidence score
    ↓
Return: True (INTERRUPT)
    ↓
Agent stops speaking
```

### Handling VAD vs STT Timing

**Challenge**: VAD detects speech faster than STT transcribes text.

**Solution**: 
- We don't modify VAD (as per requirements)
- Our logic layer uses STT transcript in `_should_interrupt()`
- Framework coordinates timing automatically
- By the time our method is called, we have the transcript
- Decision happens before audio is cut

---

## Customization

### Adding New Words

**Example**: Add "yup" as a soft acknowledgment

```python
# In interruption_config.py
SOFT_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS = [
    "yeah",
    "ok",
    "hmm",
    "yup",  # ← Add here
]
```

Restart agent. Done! ✅

### Adjusting Timing Sensitivity

Make interrupts easier after 5 seconds instead of 8:

```python
# In interruption_config.py
LONG_SPEECH_THRESHOLD = 5.0  # Changed from 8.0
```

### Creating Custom Patterns

For advanced users, modify the classifier:

```python
# In interruption_handler.py
class AdvancedInterruptionClassifier:
    def _build_patterns(self):
        # Add custom regex patterns
        self.custom_patterns = [
            r'\b(custom|word)\b'
        ]
```

```

### Modularity

**Separation of concerns**:
- `interruption_handler.py`: Core logic (reusable)
- `interruption_config.py`: Configuration (easy to modify)
- `smart_interruption_agent.py`: Integration layer

**Benefits**:
- Easy to test individual components
- Configuration changes don't require code changes
- Handler can be reused in other projects

### State Management

The agent maintains its speaking state:

```python
async def _on_agent_speech_started(self):
    self._agent_speaking = True
    self.interruption_handler.update_agent_state(AgentState.SPEAKING)

async def _on_agent_speech_stopped(self):
    self._agent_speaking = False
    self.interruption_handler.update_agent_state(AgentState.IDLE)
```

This ensures the handler always has current context.

### Confidence Scoring

Instead of binary yes/no, we use weighted confidence:

```python
final_score = (
    semantic_score * 0.5 +   # Pattern matching result
    timing_score * 0.3 +      # Speech duration adjustment
    urgency_score * 0.2       # Audio urgency boost
)

# Decision threshold
should_interrupt = final_score > 0.7
```

This allows for nuanced decisions based on multiple factors.

## Performance

### Latency Metrics

- **Pattern matching**: < 50ms
- **STT transcription**: ~200-500ms (Deepgram Nova-3)
- **Audio analysis**: < 10ms
- **Total decision time**: ~250-550ms

### Real-Time Operation

The system maintains real-time performance because:

1. **Pattern matching is O(n)** where n = number of patterns (~10-20)
2. **Audio analysis uses simple DSP** (no ML inference)
3. **No network calls** during decision logic
4. **Synchronous decisions** (no async overhead in critical path)

### Optimization Notes

- Regex patterns compiled once at startup
- Audio features cached per utterance
- State updates are in-memory only
- No database or external service calls

---

## Technical Details

### Pattern Priority

Patterns are checked in order:

1. **Hard interruptions** (highest priority)
2. **Polite interruptions** (medium priority)
3. **Soft acknowledgments** (lowest priority)

This ensures "yeah wait" correctly triggers an interrupt.

### Audio Feature Extraction

Simple but effective DSP:

```python
def extract_audio_features(audio_chunk):
    volume = calculate_rms(audio_chunk)
    pitch = estimate_fundamental_frequency(audio_chunk)
    duration = len(audio_chunk) / sample_rate
    
    return AudioFeatures(volume, pitch, duration)
```

No ML models needed - keeps latency low.
